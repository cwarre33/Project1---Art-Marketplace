# Potential Concerns & Solutions

## Technical Concerns
1. **Performance**
   - *Concern*: Image-heavy marketplace could lead to slow loading
   - *Solution*: Implement lazy loading, image optimization, and CDN usage

2. **State Management**
   - *Concern*: Complex product filtering and cart management
   - *Solution*: Use Alpine.js for simple state management, consider Vuex for scaling

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - *Concern*: Complex layouts might break on mobile
   - *Solution*: Mobile-first development approach, extensive testing on different devices

## UX Concerns
1. **Filter Complexity**
   - *Concern*: Too many filter options might overwhelm users
   - *Solution*: Implement progressive disclosure, show most used filters first

2. **Search Effectiveness**
   - *Concern*: Users might not find desired products
